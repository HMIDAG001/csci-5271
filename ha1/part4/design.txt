DESIGN PRINCIPLES
Our first design principle that we would like to advise the makers of BCVI on is
the implementation of fail-safe defaults. In general, input should be checked
against a whitelist rather than a blacklist. Additionally, input should be 
sanitized before it used. This input could be from arguments to BCVI, 
environment variables, or user input during execution. While BCVI already 
addresses these issues in some places, like the filter buffer ex-mode command 
(:%!) and the macro feature, there are still potential vulnerabilites in other 
areas of BCVI through environment variables.

Our second design principle that we would also advise would be the 
implementation of separtion of privilege. BCVI currently checks the .conf file 
to see if a user has permission to modify a file that they normally would not 
have access to. By implementing a second access policy in BCVI, it would be more
difficult for an attacker to gain permissions not normally given to them. This 
could be done by implementing a special UNIX group such that only members of 
that group would be granted permissions to files listed within sudobcvi.conf.
 
Finally, we would like to advise the makers of BCVI to implement the design 
principle of least privilege. sudobcvi will always run with root privileges for 
the duration of its execution. This is not necessary when the file being edited 
does not require special permission. As soon as sudobcvi detects that the user 
already has permission to edit the current file, it should drop its root 
privileges.
